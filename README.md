# Book Creator Quiz
The next evolution of the Book Creator app is here - yes, it's Book Creator Quiz. Not really, this repl is the candidate test for the Book Creator engineering team.

## Software Engineer Role
Your task is to implement a leaderboard so that someone who has completed the quiz can see how they did in relation to other people.

### Steps
1. Fork this repl.
2. Press the big green "Run" button at the top of your new fork.
3. Have a nose around - we might want to discuss the code with you during the next stage of the hiring process.
4. Do the task.
5. Either invite [@DanPorter](https://replit.com/@DanPorter/) and [@tteggel](https://replit.com/@tteggel/) to your forked repl, or let us know that you're done and where your fork is. We will then fork your repl again and have a play.

### Guidance
You will probably want to use the [replit database](https://docs.replit.com/hosting/database-faq) to keep things simple but you should feel free to use any other APIs or technology. The only constraint is that we should be able to run your forked repl and use the site without any further set up required by us. You might use [replit auth](https://docs.replit.com/hosting/authenticating-users-repl-auth). Or you might not, up to you.

Don't spend too long on this - we think that the core task should be achievable in an hour or two but there are enough ways to gold-plate things that you could spend a week here. Please don't do that.

The requirement is intentionally quite vague - we will accept any assumptions you make so long as you can justify them to us. Feel free to get in touch with the person that sent you this test if you want to ask any clarifying questions.

Good luck!

## Tester Role
Explore, find bugs, investigate.

### Steps
1. Explore.
2. Find bugs.
3. Investigate.

### Guidance
There are bugs. We'd like you to talk us through how you found them, whether you can spot an obvious cause and what you think we should do about them.

We'd also like your opinion on the existing unit tests as well as how you would approach adding end-to-end automation to this exciting project.

Good luck!
